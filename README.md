# MQTTSonoff
A small and simple firmware for the Sonoff Devices to add MQTT functionallity to it.

# Notes
This is a rewrite of my original code to look nice again, because it was a mess after the first tests etc... You may know what i'm talking about :)
I will continue to add more devices like Sonoff Touch, 4CH and 2CH Sonoff, but they not here yet. For know only the 1CH is working so far.
